# Solved Problems Fundamentals of Physics Halliday & Resnick with python
Hello everyone
This project involves solving questions from the book Physics by Halliday and Resnick, Volume 1, in which I have tried to include questions that seem useful to simulate and solve with programming. 
The goal of this work is to strengthen the problem-solving power of physics and programming so that questions that can be simulated can be better understood.
